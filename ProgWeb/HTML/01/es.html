  <p id="intro">We'll begin our study of web programming by learning the core language for writing web pages:
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML describes the contents of your page, such as headings, paragraphs, images,
    and lists.
    The version of HTML we'll learn is the latest and most standard, called HTML5. The pages you'll write will work in
    any modern browser.
    This chapter doesn't attempt to provide a complete list of HTML tags and attributes. Certain aspects of the
    language, such as forms and tables, are left for later chapters that focus on those elements.</p>

  

  <h2>2.1 Basic HTML</h2>
  <p>In this section we'll discuss the basics of HTML and web pages, as well as a brief history of the language and how
    it came to be the way it is today. In following sections we'll dive into the details of HTML syntax for creating
    complex web pages.</p>

  <h2>2.1.1 History</h2>
  <p>
    Since its creation in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, one of the founding fathers of the Internet, HTML has been the
    dominant language for creating web pages. HTML is a language consisting of text content surrounded by markings that
    specify the meaning of the content. As with many languages, HTML has gone through different versions and
    standardization processes over the years:
  <ul>
    <li>1993: Initial official proposed description of HTML submitted to the IETF standards group.</li>
    <li>1995: HTML 2 becomes an official standard language by a publication called RFC 1866.</li>
    <li>1996-97: HTML 3.2 standardizes various features including forms, tables, image maps, and internationalization.
    </li>
    <li>1997: HTML 4 is proposed by W3C standards body, adding style sheets, scripting, frames, embedding objects,
      internationalization, and accessibility for disabilities.</li>
    <li>HTML 4.01, the last major version of the language, is published in 1999 by W3C. A majority of the pages on the
      web today still use HTML 4.01 as their stated language.</li>
    <li>2000-01: XHTML, a more standardized offshoot of HTML based on a language named XML, is proposed by W3C.</li>
    <li>2011-12: HTML5, an ambitious new version of the web language intended to address the evolution of the web into a
      platform for applications and multimedia, is developed by W3C.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The language has several major goals that are reflected in the evolution made to it over the years. Each new
    version has endeavored to: add new features; improve interoperability, make HTML compatible with all major browsers,
    platforms, and devices; and be accessible to all kinds of users, including those with disabilities affecting sight
    and hearing.
    In these chapters we will focus on HTML5, a more recently created dialect of HTML. HTML5 is a more modern and
    stricter language than older versions of HTML, and its syntax is more regular and standardized. HTML5 has a more
    clearly refined set of goals than past versions of HTML. While older HTML was a mixed language used to describe a
    document's content, appearance, and behavior, properly written HTML5 chooses to focus solely on describing the
    document's content and structure. The tasks of describing exactly how the document should look and how it should
    behave are handled by other languages that interact with HTML.
    At the time of this writing, not all web browsers support every new feature of HTML5 properly. For this reason,
    throughout the textbook when we show a feature that is new to HTML5, we will place the official HTML5 "shield" logo
    next to that feature: This way you will be aware that the feature may not work properly for users with older
    browsers. Every web developer must face the difficult decision between utilizing the newest features and reaching
    the widest possible audience.</p>

  <p>A well-written web page has the following division of responsibilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML describes the content of the document.</li>
    <li>Style Sheets (written in a language named CSS) describe the appearance of the document.</li>
    <li>Scripts (written in languages such as JavaScript) describe the behavior of the document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will learn the HTML syntax in detail throughout this chapter and later chapters. Example 2.1 shows an initial
    example of a complete HTML document. Figure 2.1 shows the output when you save the above code into a file called
    wonderfulworld.html and open it in the Firefox browser.
    In general it does not matter what name you give to your HTML file, but one particular file name is worth mentioning.
    Most web servers consider the filename index.html (and similar names such as index.php, index.jsp, etc. ) to represent
    the main page for a particular web site. So if you omit the file name from a URL, index.html is assumed to be the
    filename. This is useful because, for example, you can tell people your web site's URL is http://www.example.com/, and
    when they visit that URL, they'll actually be shown the contents of http://www.example.com/index.html.
